# VERIFROG TODOs

* "drain" keyword which waits until the current event queue is empty before continuing on with tests
* Add alias for signal names support

## Possible future improvements

* Add ability to use arbitrary verilog expressions in the varval field:
  ` var = (other_sig + 4'b1101 >> 2) `
