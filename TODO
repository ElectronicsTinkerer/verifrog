# VERIFROG TODOs

## TODO

< Nothing? >

## Possible future improvements

* Add ability to use arbitrary verilog expressions in the varval field:
  ` var = (other_sig + 4'b1101 >> 2) `
* Convert flex/bison to use reentrant scheme instead of global vars
* Generic/parameter definitions
* Add CLI flag to select between continuing on error and $stop()ing

## TO-DOne

* Move expect out of set's grammar, allowing multiple time slots of expect for a single set operation
* "drain" keyword which waits until the current event queue is empty before continuing on with tests
* Add alias for signal names support
* Add proper freeing of memory (fix that *everything* is currently leaked...)
* Add indication of clock signal's name
* Add parsing of integer literals in set/expect blocks and conversion to binary string
* Add generation of data file for verilog TB
* Add TB generation itself
* Free symbol table
* Display time and tick of errors
