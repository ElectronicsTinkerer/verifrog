# VERIFROG TODOs

## TODO

* Add alias for signal names support

## Possible future improvements

* Add ability to use arbitrary verilog expressions in the varval field:
  ` var = (other_sig + 4'b1101 >> 2) `

## TO-DOne

* Move expect out of set's grammar, allowing multiple time slots of expect for a single set operation
* "drain" keyword which waits until the current event queue is empty before continuing on with tests
